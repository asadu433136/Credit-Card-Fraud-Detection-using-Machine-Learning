# Project Title

Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

## Description

This project report illustrates the most appropriate performance measures to be used for fraud detection purposes. Next, the dataset will be resampled before training the model. Then, we design and assess a novel learning strategy that effectively addresses detecting credit card frauds. Three techniques are applied to the dataset, and Python language is used to get the job done. According to sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score, Precision, Recall, and MCC, technical performance is evaluated for various variables. The results were a combination of these models that has been optimized based on the MCC score.

## Getting Started

### Dataframe Implementation


**Dataset


The dataset contained transactions from a European credit card holder for two days in September 2013. Very few transactions are actually fraudulent (less than 1%). The data set is highly skewed, consisting of 492 frauds in a total of 284,807 observations. This resulted in only 0.172% fraud cases. The low number of fraudulent transactions justifies this skewed set.The dataset consists of numerical values from the 28 ‘Principal Component Analysis (PCA)’ transformed features, namely V1 to V28.

### Methodology


**Proposed Methodology


*Deep Neural Networking (DNN)

*Random Forest (RF)

*Support Vector Machine (SVM)

*XGBoost Classifier (XGB)

*Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)






### Analysis Final Performence

**Overview of portfolios

For simplicity, we refer to companies as its region name, for example, “Large Caps EUROPE” . With regards to large caps EUROPE portfolio, from 01.01.2017 to end of 2020, SAP is the best performer as it always tops the other two companies with ALV.DE being the worst performer.
