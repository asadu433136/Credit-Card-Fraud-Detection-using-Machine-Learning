# Project Title

Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

## Description

This project report illustrates the most appropriate performance measures to be used for fraud detection purposes. Next, the dataset will be resampled before training the model. Then, we design and assess a novel learning strategy that effectively addresses detecting credit card frauds. Three techniques are applied to the dataset, and Python language is used to get the job done. According to sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score, Precision, Recall, and MCC, technical performance is evaluated for various variables. The results were a combination of these models that has been optimized based on the MCC score.

## Getting Started

### Dataframe Implementation

### Methodology

**K-means Clustering Algorithm


**Vectorized backtesting


### Analysis Final Performence

**Overview of portfolios

For simplicity, we refer to companies as its region name, for example, “Large Caps EUROPE” . With regards to large caps EUROPE portfolio, from 01.01.2017 to end of 2020, SAP is the best performer as it always tops the other two companies with ALV.DE being the worst performer.
